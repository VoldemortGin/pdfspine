# PRD-NEXT — Remaining Work Roadmap (code-verified)

> **What this file is.** The single live to-do list for resuming the pdfspine build, **re-verified against
> the actual source on 2026-06-19** and re-prioritized around the public release. It tracks ONLY what is
> LEFT; the record of DONE work lives in git history + commit messages, `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` (accuracy),
> `COMPAT.toml` / `PARITY.md` (API parity), and `conformance/gt/*-REPORT.md` (machine metrics).
>
> **How priorities are set.** The plan pivots on the first public PyPI tag: **Phase 0** = must-fix-before-tag
> blockers · **Phase 1** = pre-launch quality (cheap, high-credibility) · **Phase 2** = launch parity push ·
> **Phase 3** = post-launch correctness · **Phase 4** = post-launch capability. **§3 is the correction log**
> for where the *previous* A–F framing of this doc was wrong vs the code — read it first if you remember the
> old structure.
>
> **Single source of truth.** Per-symbol disposition lives in **`COMPAT.toml`**, generated from
> `scripts/_compat_catalog.py` (guarded in CI). **Never hand-edit `COMPAT.toml`** — change dispositions in
> the catalog and regenerate.

## 1. Snapshot (verified 2026-06-19)

- **Gate:** 1349 Rust tests + 593 pytest fns floor (locally 658 pytest passed / 1 skipped / 8 xfailed) green ·
  clippy `-D warnings` clean on both lean and OCR variants · 0 real `TODO`/`unimplemented!`/`panic!` in
  `crates/` (4 guarded `unreachable!`) · full 7-job CI matrix over 3 OSes × 4 Pythons + an OIDC
  trusted-publishing `release.yml`. (The only local failures — 3 Rust + 7 pytest OCR tests — stem from a
  broken local tesseract/leptonica install, an env defect, not code; a clean machine still meets the
  1349/593 floors.)
- **API parity:** **682 / 769 implemented (88.7%)** — consistent across `COMPAT.toml`, README, and PARITY.md.
  21 deferred · 66 out-of-scope. Phase 2 landed +29; **P4-1** then added `Font.buffer`/`glyph_bbox` (Font class
  22/23). The remaining 21 deferred are the long tail (OCG layers, device-replay, a few Type0/Type3 edges).
- **Text extraction:** at fitz parity for **single-column AND multi-column**. The multi-column engine landed
  (06-16 PM) and **P3-2 verified it** (2026-06-20, fresh GT): PMC order **0.965 / 0.995** vs fitz 0.975/0.997,
  born-digital **0.996** vs 1.000 — within 0.000–0.009 per column doc (PMC212687 0.083→0.996, born 2col
  0.549→0.997). CJK / EUR-Lex / GovInfo at parity; Arabic/bidi beats fitz (logical order, UAX#9 reorder). One
  ordering-only residual: PMC212689 (order 0.645, tokens all present) → P3-1r.
- **Rendering (`get_pixmap`):** prior SSIM **0.945 mean / 0.986 median** vs fitz was dragged down by **blank
  non-embedded standard-14 body text** (**fixed in P1-1**, Liberation OFL fallback, ink coverage +5..+10 pts).
  **P3-3** then fixed Indexed/Separation/DeviceN colorspaces + `/Decode` (pixel-exact vs fitz on synthetic
  cases). Residuals: Symbol/ZapfDingbats fallback (→ P1-1r); pre-existing naive CMYK→RGB (→ P3-3r). A fresh
  aggregate SSIM re-measure against the now-present `.venv-oracle` is still worth doing.
- **OCR:** Tesseract adapter + pure-Rust PaddleOCR (PP-OCRv4 via `tract`) both shipped, Python-selectable,
  scanned→searchable proven end-to-end, beats fitz on CJK. Wheel-bloat **resolved** and the publishing path
  is **decided + implemented** (P0-5r): the published `pdfspine` wheel compiles OCR in but embeds **no
  models** (~7 MB compressed; the `cargo` build default stays lean), and the ~16 MB models ship as a separate
  `pdfspine-ocr-models` data distribution the `[ocr]` extra pulls in (`pip install pdfspine[ocr]`); models
  resolve at runtime `PDFSPINE_OCR_MODELS` → companion → in-repo dev fallback (offline, no download). The
  per-box `recognize()` loop is now **rayon-parallel** (P4-3 done: 3.49× on a 42-box page, byte-identical).
- **Performance:** pdfspine **beats fitz on open (1.26×)** and **text (2.75×)** — the ops users actually
  call; render is 1.74× faster than before but still ~2.3× slower than pypdfium2 (a C engine, not the parity
  target). **All render-perf work is deferred** — see §5 "Deferred for v1".

## 2. Harness (reuse, don't rebuild)

Objective ground-truth + differential harness in `conformance/gt/` (scripts committed; corpora/cache/
`*-results.json` gitignored, regenerable):
- `run_gt.py` — scores pdfspine vs fitz vs pdfminer vs SAME ground truth → `GT-REPORT.md`.
- `score.py` — decomposed metrics (lev/f1/jaccard/order), CJK-aware, NFKC.
- Fetchers: `born_digital.py`, `born_cjk.py`, `born_arabic.py`, `pmc_fetch.py`, `fetch_eurlex.py` (8 langs),
  `fetch_govinfo.py`, `fetch_robustness.py` (GovDocs1/SafeDocs, zip64 range-extraction).
- `tables_diff.py` — find_tables vs fitz (currently fitz-**agreement** only, no gold GT — see Phase 3).
  `render_diff.py` — get_pixmap vs fitz (SSIM).
- Real-corpus differential: `conformance/run_validation.py` + `fetch_corpus.py`.
- **Venvs:** `.venv` (pdfspine wheel) is the engine under test; `.venv-oracle` (real fitz 1.24.14 + pdfminer +
  pypdfium2 + rapidocr) is the GROUND-TRUTH oracle. **In `.venv`, `import fitz` is the pdfspine SHIM** — for
  true correctness always cross-check against `.venv-oracle`. No oracle output is ever committed. **Set up
  (2026-06-20):** `.venv-oracle` now holds real PyMuPDF **1.24.14 / MuPDF 1.24.11** (the COMPAT baseline) and is
  the live fitz reference (`.venv-oracle/bin/python`). Regenerate via `.venv/bin/python -m venv .venv-oracle &&
  .venv-oracle/bin/python -m pip install pymupdf==1.24.14 pdfminer.six pypdfium2`.
- **Reproducibility debt — RESOLVED (P0-6 + P0-6r):** committed manifests/reports no longer hard-code
  `/workspace/pypdf`, and `run_gt.py` now resolves each corpus pdf/nxml relative to its manifest dir (falling
  back to the basename beside the manifest), so even the gitignored corpus manifests' stale absolute paths no
  longer break scoring after a rename. (Closed while regenerating the GT reports during P3-2.)

## 3. Correction log — where the previous A–F framing was wrong

This doc used to be organized as priority areas A (OCR) / B (parity) / C (rendering) / D (extraction) /
E (perf) / F (polish) with HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW labels. A code-verified survey found that framing materially
mis-stated the work. The phased plan in §4 replaces it. Key corrections (all carry `file:line` evidence):

| # | Old framing said | Verified reality | Where |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | (silent) | **Version hard-pinned `0.0.0`**; no tag→version in `release.yml`. A tagged release ships a `0.0.0` wheel. **Hard blocker.** **✅ FIXED in Phase 0 (P0-1).** | `pyproject.toml:8`, `Cargo.toml:24`, `crates/py-bindings/src/lib.rs:33`, `.github/workflows/release.yml:48` |
| C2 | §7: "always `PdfUnsupportedError`, never `AttributeError`" | **~50 of 56 deferred symbols raise bare `AttributeError`.** `_UNIMPLEMENTED_*` maps cover only 2; the guard never checks runtime behavior. **✅ FIXED in Phase 0 (P0-2)** for the 40 Page/Document deferred symbols; 12 deferred members on non-subclassable `_core` types still `AttributeError` (→ P0-2r). | `python/pdfspine/document.py:37,2276,3700`, `scripts/compat-symbol-guard.py` |
| C3 | §F: Font-program refactor is the keystone that unblocks std-14 rendering | **False.** Renderer builds its own `GlyphFont` from `/FontFile*`; never consults `pdf_fonts::Font`. Std-14 fix = bundle a fallback family (independent). Refactor payoff = +2 API symbols only. | `crates/pdf-render/src/render.rs:497,528`, `crates/pdf-fonts/src/font.rs` |
| C4 | §D: "text already at parity, diminishing returns" | Read as overstated off a **stale 06-16-morning report** (PMC 0.08–0.44, born 0/6); the multi-column engine landed 06-16 PM and **✅ P3-2 verified parity** (2026-06-20): PMC order 0.965/0.995, born 0.996 vs fitz, reports regenerated. Residual: PMC212689 ordering (→ P3-1r). | `conformance/gt/GT-REPORT-pmc.md`, `GT-REPORT-born.md` |
| C5 | (an earlier draft claimed a 648-vs-647 count drift) | **No drift** — that "648" was a `grep` artifact counting the comment legend line. COMPAT body, `[meta]`, README, and PARITY are all consistent at **647 / 84.1%**. No doc-number change needed. | `COMPAT.toml:31`, `README.md:14`, `PARITY.md:40` |
| C6 | 4 symbols listed deferred | `Page.links`, `Page.first_link`, `Document.outline`, `Document.extract_image` are **implemented + live** (missed by `_reconcile_batch34`). Free +4. **✅ FIXED in Phase 0 (P0-3)** — flipped + COMPAT regenerated to 651 / 84.7%. | `python/pdfspine/document.py:1513,1518,3206,3038` |
| C7 | §3.B `convert_to_pdf` = "heavy ops" / stub | Rust impl **finished** (`imagedoc::convert_to_pdf`, `image_to_pdf`); just **unexposed** in py-bindings. Image-input case is a small binding task. | `crates/pdf-image/src/imagedoc.rs:137`, `crates/pdf-api/src/image.rs:206` |
| C8 | §E render-perf TODOs (glyph cache, q/Q clones, rayon, JPEG2000) | Mostly mis-stated: outline-Path **and** ObjRef program caches **exist**; paints split-borrow (only `Canvas::save` clones); `get_pixmap` **already releases the GIL** (cross-page parallelism works today); JPEG2000 is **already a wired codec** (upstream-bound). | `crates/pdf-render/src/render.rs:434,471`, `canvas.rs:173`, `py-bindings/src/lib.rs:1802`, `codecs/jpx.rs` |
| C9 | §C: "synthetic-bold renders heavier than fitz" | **Unsupported** — no embolden code path exists. If anything pdfspine renders *lighter*. | `crates/pdf-render` |
| C10 | (silent) | **3 CI "guard" scripts are always-exit-0 M0 stubs** wired as named green checks (incl. the AGPL/license-provenance gate) — false confidence. **✅ FIXED in Phase 0 (P0-4)** — all 3 now enforce real invariants (proven by canary-and-revert); license provenance is enforced affirmatively via an allowlist instead of a raw GPL byte-scan (which false-positived on real public-domain fixtures). | `scripts/{test-order-guard,catalog-status-guard,manifest-lint}.py`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml:152` |
| C11 | §5: "folder rename = FINAL step" | Folder rename is **done** (cwd is `pdfspine`), but 7 committed files still hard-code `/workspace/pypdf` — harness reproducibility is broken until cleaned. **✅ FIXED in Phase 0 (P0-6)** — committed reports de-absolutized to repo-relative; only the gitignored/regenerable corpus manifests remain (→ P0-6r). | `conformance/gt/corpus-*/manifest.json`, `GT-REPORT-tables.md` |
| C12 | (silent) | **Silent wrong-answers:** `Page.get_text(clip=...)` drops the clip for `text/dict/json/html`; `Font(fontfile=/fontbuffer=)` silently returns Helvetica; `get_textpage_ocr(full=False)` silently does full-page OCR. | `crates/py-bindings/src/lib.rs:1481,4081,1527` |
| C13 | §3.B Pixmap(3) grouped flat | `samples_ptr` / `__array_interface__` are **small** (ride the existing `samples_mv` buffer protocol); only `warp` is medium. | `crates/py-bindings/src/lib.rs:3684,3697` |
| C14 | §E OCR: only "more languages" + "model distribution" | **OCR `recognize()` per-box loop is sequential** — rayon-parallelizing it is the single biggest *absolute-time* OCR speedup (seconds/page), far bigger than any render-perf item. | `crates/pdf-ocr/src/paddle/mod.rs:77` |

## 4. Phased plan

Effort: **S** ≈ hours · **M** ≈ 1–2 days · **L** ≈ multi-day. Each task lists **why · files · effort/impact
· Acceptance** (the green condition that means "done").

### Phase 0 — COMPLETE (2026-06-19) — committed on branch `phase0-blockers` (98a437a; P0-5r in ff6495c)

All six blockers landed and were verified (full §8 suite). Done summary:

- **P0-1 · Version-from-tag** — DONE. `pyproject.toml` `dynamic = ["version"]`; `__version__` resolves via `importlib.metadata` (falls back to `_core.__version__` in a raw tree); new `scripts/set_version_from_tag.py` bumps the workspace `Cargo.toml` + first-party path-dep reqs; `release.yml` gained a tag-guarded set-version step in both the wheels matrix and sdist jobs. Dev tree stays `0.0.0`; a tagged CI build ships the tag (proven with `v9.9.9`, reverted).
- **P0-2 · Deferred → `PdfUnsupportedError`** — DONE for the 40 Page/Document deferred symbols. Catalog now emits `python/pdfspine/_compat_deferred.py` (a self-maintaining `frozenset`, ships in the wheel); `Page/Document.__getattr__` route deferred members through it → `PdfUnsupportedError` with name+hint. Dead `_UNIMPLEMENTED_PAGE['get_pixmap']` removed; new `test_deferred_symbols.py`; `compat-symbol-guard.py` extended with lockstep + runtime checks. **Residual → P0-2r.**
- **P0-3 · Flip 4 + regen COMPAT** — DONE. The 4 flipped deferred→implemented in `_compat_catalog.py`; COMPAT regenerated to **651 / 52 / 66 = 769, coverage 84.7%**; README + PARITY counts refreshed (Document 119/17, Page 92/23). No count drift; the 4 verified live/non-stub via the in-process fitz shim (`.venv-oracle` unavailable — see §2).
- **P0-4 · Real CI guards** — DONE. All three (`test-order-guard`, `catalog-status-guard`, `manifest-lint`) now enforce real invariants, each proven by a canary-and-revert: catalog-guard re-renders COMPAT + baseline in-process and byte-compares; test-order-guard enforces 1:1 between catalog `red` rows and `RED: <ID>` source tags; manifest-lint enforces the affirmative-license allowlist + well-formed sha256 + no stale absolute paths. The raw GPL byte-scan was dropped (false-positived on real public-domain fixtures).
- **P0-5 · OCR wheel-bloat → feature-split** — DONE. `paddle-ocr` is default-OFF across pdf-ocr / pdf-api / py-bindings (`ocr` alias on py-bindings); models load at runtime from `PDFSPINE_OCR_MODELS`/`models/`. Lean default cdylib **6.75 MB** (was 37.1 MB); OCR build 21.4 MB; lean install raises `PdfUnsupportedError` pointing to `pdfspine[ocr]`. **Residual P0-5r — ✅ RESOLVED (see below).**
- **P0-6 · CHANGELOG + stale paths** — DONE. New `CHANGELOG.md` (Keep-a-Changelog + SemVer); `GT-REPORT-tables.md` de-absolutized to repo-relative; `run_gt.py` already resolves repo-root-relative. **Residual → P0-6r.**

**Residuals carried forward:**

- **P0-2r · 12 `_core` PyO3 deferred members still raise `AttributeError`** — *Rust-core* — the deferred members on non-subclassable `_core` types (Pixmap / DisplayList / Tools) can't route through the Python `__getattr__` path; making them raise `PdfUnsupportedError` needs a Rust-core change (outside the Python-scoped P0-2). Tracked as xfail + a COMPAT note.
- **P0-5r · OCR publishing — ✅ RESOLVED (2026-06-19, commit `ff6495c`)** — chose **Option A: a model-data companion + the OCR feature compiled into the published wheel**. The published `pdfspine` wheel compiles the `ocr` feature in (via `[tool.maturin] features`) but embeds no models; the ~16 MB models ship as a new `pdfspine-ocr-models` data distribution (`packages/pdfspine-ocr-models/`, hatchling force-include from `crates/pdf-ocr/models` — no git duplication) that the `[ocr]` extra depends on. `document.py` sets `PDFSPINE_OCR_MODELS` from the installed companion for `engine="paddle"`; resolution order PDFSPINE_OCR_MODELS → companion → in-repo dev fallback → clear `PdfUnsupportedError`. `release.yml` publishes both dists via OIDC trusted publishing; `docs/RELEASE-PYPI.md` §D.1 documents the flow.
- **P0-6r · `fetch_corpus.py` relative paths** — the gitignored/regenerable corpus manifests (`conformance/gt/corpus-*/manifest.json`) still embed absolute paths; `fetch_corpus.py` should emit manifest-relative pdf paths so future regenerations stay rename-proof.

### Phase 1 — COMPLETE (2026-06-19) — committed on `main`

All three pre-launch quality items landed and were verified (full §8 suite; the new accuracy gate green). Done summary:

- **P1-1 · Liberation std-14 fallback fonts** — DONE. Bundled the 12 base-14-covering **Liberation 2.1.5** faces (**SIL OFL 1.1**, ~4.2 MB) under `crates/pdf-fonts/fonts/liberation/`; `render.rs::liberation_substitute` maps standard-14 names (+ Arial/Times New Roman/Courier New aliases, refined by `/FontDescriptor` serif/fixed-pitch/italic/force-bold) to them when a simple font has no embedded `/FontFile*`. Non-embedded Helvetica/Times/Courier body text now renders real glyphs instead of blank (real-page ink coverage +5..+10 pts; a bare `/Helvetica` with no `/FontDescriptor` also covered). `std_widths` stays authoritative for advances. NOTICE + per-dir PROVENANCE + `docs/guide/license.md` carry the OFL provenance. **Residual → P1-1r** (Symbol/ZapfDingbats not covered — no regression).
- **P1-2 · `/Decode [1 0]` ImageMask** — DONE. `draw_image_mask` reads `/Decode` (or inline `/D`) and inverts which sample paints; an inverted stencil no longer fills solid. Regression test added.
- **P1-3 · CI accuracy/SSIM regression gate** — DONE. Three tiny clean-room **CC0-1.0** born-digital fixtures (`fixtures/born/`, reproducible via `conformance/gt/make_ci_fixtures.py`, manifest-lint-cleared); `run_gt.py` gained a **no-oracle** reading-order gate vs inlined `gt_text` (`ci_manifest.json`) and `render_diff.py` a **committed-reference SSIM** gate (`conformance/gt/ssim-refs/`, captured post-fix). New `ci.yml` `accuracy-gate` job fails on regression. Thresholds carry margin (order 0.90, SSIM 0.97); both fail-paths verified. **Note:** with `.venv-oracle` absent, the SSIM gate is self-referential against committed buffers (still catches any renderer change — the requested no-oracle design).

**Residual carried forward:**

- **P1-1r · Symbol/ZapfDingbats fallback** — *S · Low* — the two non-Latin standard-14 fonts aren't covered by Liberation (`liberation_substitute` returns `None`); wire a reasonable symbol fallback or accept as a documented deviation. No regression vs today.

### Phase 2 — COMPLETE (2026-06-20) — committed on `main`

All four parity-push clusters landed (+29 symbols, coverage 84.7%→88.4%, deferred 52→23) and were
oracle-cross-checked against real PyMuPDF 1.24.14 (`.venv-oracle`) with zero regressions. Done summary:

- **P2-1 · Page draw-convenience + loader/alias cluster (12 symbols, pure-Python)** — DONE. `draw_curve`/`draw_quad`/`draw_sector`/`draw_squiggle`/`draw_zigzag` (page-level draw convenience over `Shape`), `load_links`/`update_link`, `load_annot`/`load_widget`, `delete_widget`, `cluster_drawings`, `is_wrapped` — all flipped + regen + oracle-checked + tested.
- **P2-2 · `Document.convert_to_pdf` (image inputs)** — DONE (1 symbol). The finished Rust impl (C7) is now exposed; `Document.open` transparently handles image files, raising `PdfUnsupportedError` only for non-image input (fitz-correct). Oracle-checked.
- **P2-3 · Small binding clusters (9 symbols)** — DONE. `Pixmap.samples_ptr`/`Pixmap.__array_interface__` (numpy zero-copy), `Tools.image_profile` + module-level `image_profile`, `Page.language`/`set_language`, `Page.set_contents`, `Document.get_outline_xrefs`, `Document.embfile_upd` — all flipped + regen + oracle-checked + tested.
- **P2-4 · Medium parity items (7 symbols)** — DONE. TOC edits (`Document.set_toc_item`/`del_toc_item`), `Document.version_count`, `Document.extract_font`, `Document.subset`, `Page.add_widget`, `Page.add_caret_annot` — semantics validated vs `.venv-oracle` (fitz's in-place rewrite, not full rebuild).

**Residuals carried forward:**

- **P2r-1 · `set_toc` page-mapping off-by-one** — *S · correctness* — pre-existing: pdfspine's `get_toc` resolves `set_toc`-created destinations one page low (off-by-one in the dest page mapping). Flagged while landing the P2-4 TOC edits; left untouched as out-of-scope for the parity batch.
- **P2r-2 · `image_profile` dict-key divergence** — *S · Low* — pdfspine's `image_profile` returns `'colorspace'` (an int component count) where the PyMuPDF spec uses `'colorspace.n'`, omits `'type'`/`'size'`, and adds `orientation`/`transform`/`xres`/`yres`/`cs-name`. Matches the documented contract but not byte-for-byte the spec dict shape.

**Note:** three P2 symbols (`image_profile`, `Pixmap.__array_interface__`, `Page.set_language`) could **not** be live-diffed because PyMuPDF 1.24.14's own runtime is broken for them (SWIG marshalling bugs); pdfspine implements the **documented PyMuPDF contract** for these.

### Phase 3 — Post-launch correctness

- **P3-1 · Multi-column reading-order engine — ✅ EFFECTIVELY DONE (verified 2026-06-20)** — *was L · High*
  - The recursive XY-cut + occupancy-valley gutter engine **already landed** (commits `9ff0e6a`/`e56bcb9`/`633f0f6`/`06d24c8`, 06-16 PM). Fresh GT (P3-2): PMC order **0.965/0.995** vs fitz 0.975/0.997, born-digital **0.996** vs 1.000 — within 0.000–0.009 per column doc (PMC212687 0.083→0.996, born 2col 0.549→0.997, 3col 0.409→0.996). No single-column regression; the P1-3 gate now guards it.
  - **Residual → P3-1r** (*S · ordering-only*): PMC212689 scores order 0.645 vs fitz 0.749 — content at full parity (f1 0.940 / jaccard 0.868), only reading-order placement differs on this one real-world 2-col doc.

- **P3-2 · PMC near-zero collapse — ✅ DONE (2026-06-20): diagnosed as a STALE REPORT, not a bug** — *M · High*
  - Root cause: `GT-REPORT-pmc.md`/`GT-REPORT-born.md` were generated 06-16 **morning**, before the column engine landed that afternoon. Independently verified the current build is at fitz parity (PMC212687 pdfspine 69409 vs fitz 69385 chars, direct word-jaccard 0.987; born multi-column jaccard 1.0). **No content-dropping bug exists.** Both reports regenerated against the current build + oracle; `run_gt.py` stale-path resolution + score-arg-swap fixed (closing **P0-6r**).

- **P3-3 · Indexed/Separation/DeviceN colorspaces + `/Decode` — ✅ DONE (2026-06-20, `9b01deb`)** — *was L · Medium*
  - New `crates/pdf-core/src/colorspace.rs` — one coherent `ColorSpace` resolver + the shared `PdfFunction` evaluator (types 0/2/3, moved from pdf-render, generalized multi-input for DeviceN). Indexed images now look up the palette; Separation/DeviceN run the tint transform; `/Decode` is applied generally (DCT/JPX excluded to avoid double-apply); and the vector `cs`/`scn` path (`interp.rs` + `state.rs`, q/Q-saved) runs the transform so a **dark 1-component Separation fill no longer renders white**. Pixel-exact vs the fitz oracle on synthetic Indexed/Separation/DeviceN//Decode cases; 4 pdf-core unit + 6 render-integration pixel tests; P1-3 SSIM gate green (no reference drift).
  - **Residual → P3-3r** (*S · Low*): pre-existing **naive CMYK→RGB** (pure-K black renders 0,0,0 vs fitz's color-managed 34,31,31 — independent of P3-3, affects all CMYK uniformly). ICC-accurate spaces stay out-of-scope (ICCBased falls back by `/N`); DeviceN type-0 multi-axis tables use nearest-sample per non-primary axis.

- **P3-4 · Cheap correctness insurance — ✅ DONE (2026-06-20)** — *was S–M · Low–Medium*
  - **Kangxi fold:** `crates/pdf-fonts/src/cmap.rs::invert_to_cid_unicode` now NFKC-folds Kangxi Radicals (U+2F00–U+2FDF) to the canonical ideograph on the predefined-CMap / no-`/ToUnicode` path. Oracle-checked: fitz folds Kangxi (214/214) but **NOT** the CJK Radicals Supplement (U+2E80–U+2EFF) — so pdfspine folds **only Kangxi** to match fitz, and keeps U+2F00 verbatim on the explicit-`/ToUnicode` path. +3 Rust tests.
  - **Edge-case tests** (`python/tests/test_p3_4_edge_cases.py`, 6, oracle-checked): ToUnicode-less Type0 ✓, overlapping/co-located text ✓ (same char multiset as fitz), single-column vertical CJK ✓. **Residual → P3-4r:** vertical writing-mode is unimplemented in the emission path (`interp.rs:1324` hardcodes Horizontal) — multi-column vertical reorders columns vs fitz (same multiset, column order only); pinned by a tripwire test.
  - **Robustness:** new `conformance/gt/run_robustness.py` + `ROBUSTNESS-REPORT.md`; **0 panics** over N=43 GovDocs1 (target 250 — network-bound shortfall behind the local proxy; re-run on an unthrottled link to grow N).

- **P3-5 · FinTabNet gold-table GT — ⚠ INFRA DONE, score BLOCKED on data egress (2026-06-20)** — *M · Medium* (optional)
  - Built the harness for the first absolute `find_tables` cell-structure score: `conformance/gt/grits.py` (pure-stdlib **GriTS** Top+Con, AGPL-free port, 7-case self-test passes), `fetch_fintabnet.py` (FinTabNet.c, CDLA-Permissive), and a `tables_diff.py --gold` mode (parse gold → run pdfspine `find_tables` in the isolated worker → match by IoU → GriTS). Pipeline proven end-to-end (self-GriTS 1.0; a dropped-column perturbation → ~0.52/0.67). Default fitz-agreement mode unchanged.
  - **Blocked:** the FinTabNet source PDFs live on `dax-cdn.cdn.appdomain.cloud`, **TLS-blocked from this sandbox** (HF annotations fetch fine). No number was fabricated. **Unblock:** run the fetcher + `tables_diff.py --gold` from a network that reaches that CDN — emits the absolute GriTS with zero code change.

### Phase 4 — Post-launch capability / strategic

- **P4-1 · Font handle carries `/FontFile*` program bytes — ✅ DONE (2026-06-21)** — *was L · Medium (API)* · NOT the rendering keystone (C3)
  - New `Font::from_program` (via `ttf-parser`, sharing the renderer's infra): a program-backed `Font` (from `/FontFile*` or user `fontfile=`/`fontbuffer=`) now serves `buffer()` (program bytes), `glyph_bbox(chr)` (real per-glyph outline box), and a real-cmap `valid_codepoints()`. `Font(fontfile=)`/`Font(fontbuffer=)` load the real program (ValueError/OSError on bad input — **no silent Helvetica fallback**). Oracle-cross-checked on Liberation Sans (name / buffer-len / glyph_count exact). **+2 parity** (`Font.buffer`, `Font.glyph_bbox`) → 682/769, **88.7%**; Font class 22/23.
  - Note: pdfspine's `glyph_bbox` returns the **real per-glyph** box; PyMuPDF returns the font-level FontBBox for every glyph (pdfspine strictly more correct). A metrics-only Core-14 handle still raises `PdfUnsupportedError` for `buffer`/`glyph_bbox` (no license-clean bundled substitute, per repo policy).

- **P4-2 · Type1 charstring (PFB/PFA) support** — *L · Medium* (after P1-1)
  - **Why:** removes the literal worst page (eurlex `32006L0112_ES`, SSIM 0.527). Type1 embedding is rare, and once P1-1 lands, descriptor-flag substitution covers most blank Type1 fonts cheaply. Route: Type1→CFF, or a permissive pure-Rust Type1 outliner (respect the Apache-2.0 / pure-Rust positioning).
  - **Files:** `crates/pdf-render/src/text.rs:93`, `crates/pdf-render/src/render.rs:955`.

- **P4-3 · OCR `recognize()` rayon parallelism — ✅ DONE (2026-06-21)** — *was M · High (OCR latency)*
  - `PaddleOcr::recognize`'s per-box loop is now a rayon `par_iter` with an **indexed collect** → output byte-identical to the sequential version (deterministic, proven vs a captured baseline + a 1-thread-vs-N fingerprint). **3.49× speedup** on a 42-box page (16 cores: 2858ms → 819ms). The `&self`+`Mutex`/`OnceLock` model cache was already thread-safe (no `model.rs` change). `rayon` is a feature-gated (`paddle-ocr`) optional dep — **not** in the lean base wheel. No correctness change, no new symbols.

- **P4-4 · API reference docs cover the full public surface** — *M · Medium*
  - **Why:** `docs/reference/` documents only 4 of ~20 public classes, hand-written (no mkdocstrings), so it drifts. Docstrings are already rich.
  - **Files:** `docs/reference/`, `mkdocs.yml`, `python/pdfspine/__init__.py:29`.
  - **Acceptance:** every exported class/function documented (ideally auto-generated from docstrings).

## 5. Deferred for v1 (do NOT spend effort here pre-release)

- **All render-perf work:** the outline-Path + ObjRef program caches already exist; only per-occurrence
  rasterization remains, and a coverage-mask cache risks sub-pixel-AA regressions. pdfspine already beats
  fitz on open + text. Ship without it. (Optional later: per-glyph coverage-mask cache, clip-bbox bounding,
  `Rc/Arc<Mask>` on `Canvas::save` to avoid q/Q clones; per-page rayon is unnecessary — `get_pixmap`
  already releases the GIL so cross-page threading works today.)
- **ICC-accurate colorspace transform:** large pure-Rust undertaking, marginal SSIM gain — documented deviation.
- **OCMD/layers (7), `Page.run`/`DisplayList.run`/`get_textpage` (device-callback replay),
  `Page.remove_rotation`, `Annot.get_textbox`, `convert_to_pdf` non-image:** genuinely blocked (need
  `/OCProperties`+OCMD plumbing, a device-replay engine, content-stream rewriting, annot-appearance textpage).
  Keep deferred; documenting prevents wasted effort.
- **Splitting the `lib.rs` (4711 lines) / `document.py` (3738 lines) monoliths:** real friction, zero
  correctness impact, churn risk — well after release.
- **Additional OCR languages:** the bundled `ch` model covers CJK+Latin; each extra lang is ~10 MB that
  compounds the wheel-bloat problem — only after P0-5.
- **DocLayNet / more-language corpus breadth:** lower priority than P3-1, which dominates any new corpus's numbers.

**Recommended next 3 (in order):** *(Phase 0 + P0-5r + Phases 1–3 + P4-1/P4-3 COMPLETE — on `main`; parity **88.7%**; P3-5 infra done, score blocked on sandbox data egress.)*
1. **P4-4 API reference docs** (*M · Med*) — mkdocstrings the full public surface (only ~4 of ~20 classes documented today; docstrings are already rich). Good pre-public polish.
2. **P4-2 Type1 charstring (PFB/PFA)** (*L · Med*) — removes the literal worst render page (eurlex `32006L0112_ES`, SSIM 0.527); the last big render-fidelity item.
3. **The residuals** — P3-1r (PMC212689 order), P3-4r (vertical writing), P3-3r (CMYK), P0-2r (`_core` deferred), P1-1r (Symbol/Zapf), P2r-1, P2r-2 — plus re-running P3-5's GriTS from an unrestricted network.

## 7. Pre-public chores + docs upkeep (do alongside / last)

- Reword any historical commit messages that contain backticks (shell substitutes them).
- **Keep `PARITY.md` + `docs/BENCHMARKS.md` current** — they drift as batches land; refresh after each.
- Docs-site completeness pass (`docs/guide`, `docs/reference`, `index.md`) — see P4-4.
- PyPI publish runbook: `docs/RELEASE-PYPI.md` (gated on P0-1 + P0-5); optional name trademark.
- The PyPI runbook **encodes the P0-5r OCR-distribution decision** (✅ done) — the published `pdfspine` wheel compiles the `ocr` feature in (no embedded models) and the `[ocr]` extra pulls the `pdfspine-ocr-models` data distribution; see `docs/RELEASE-PYPI.md` §D.1.
- Repo stays **PRIVATE** until everything is done (Phase 0 + Phase 1 + the parity push + docs), then flip to
  public + push (`gh` authed as VoldemortGin).

## 8. Verify suite (run from repo root before every commit)

```
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace                      # expect 1349+ passed, 0 failed
source .venv/bin/activate && env -u CONDA_PREFIX maturin develop -q
env -u CONDA_PREFIX python -m pytest python/tests/ -q     # expect 593+ passed
python3 scripts/_compat_catalog.py && python3 scripts/compat-symbol-guard.py   # after any API batch
```

**Gotchas:** maturin needs `env -u CONDA_PREFIX`; commit messages must avoid backticks; only ONE agent
rebuilds the wheel at a time (shared `.venv`); always change dispositions in `scripts/_compat_catalog.py`
then regenerate — **never hand-edit `COMPAT.toml`** — and confirm coverage rises with zero regressions +
`compat-symbol-guard.py` exit 0; cross-check every API symbol against `.venv-oracle` (in `.venv`,
`import fitz` is the pdfspine shim). When a batch agent dies mid-run, check the working tree — it usually
left coherent, compiling work; verify + finish rather than restarting. **This machine's tesseract 5.5.2 /
leptonica-1.87.0 install is broken** (reproduces on a trivial external PNG: "Leptonica Error … image file
not found"), so the local OCR tests (3 Rust + 7 pytest) fail for env reasons, not code — ignore them here
and trust a clean machine / CI.
